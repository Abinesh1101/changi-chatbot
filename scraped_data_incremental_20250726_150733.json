Airport Emergency Service We provide a Category 10 level of fire protection, the highest possible fire protection coverage in accordance to ICAO standards. Airport Emergency Service Team Highly trained and always ready, the Airport Emergency Service (AES) remains on guard 24/7. Their mission is to protect and save lives, minimise property damage, and facilitate the quick return of the Changi aerodrome to normal safety operations. Airport Emergency Plan The Airport Emergency Plan at Changi coordinates the efforts of mutual aid agencies within the airport and its immediate vicinity. The AES team is responsible for managing the Airport Emergency Plan and takes charge of the rescue and fire-fighting and other crash site operations of this plan. This plan is tested annually in the form of full-scale aircraft crash exercises with good support from the mutual aid agencies. AES also responds to other emergency situations within the airport. This includes response to dangerous goods incidents or bomb warnings, as well as chemical or biological threats. Safety Infrastructure At all times, AES fire-fighting vehicles respond to the scene of an aircraft accident in 2 minutes, not exceeding 3 minutes and bring the fires under control within a minute upon arrival. This is swiftly followed by rescue and evacuation efforts to nearby medical facilities. In line with ICAO's recommendation to deal with aircraft crashes in the waters surrounding the airport, AES is equipped with sea rescue capabilities. It has a fleet of emergency resources based in a Sea Rescue Base off the waters of Changi Airport. Operating highly specialised emergency vessels and equipment in the event of aircraft incidents out at sea, the Sea Rescue Base is also the only hovercraft operator in Singapore. Aerodrome Safety The Aerodrome Safety Unit is involved in implementing and maintaining an effective and robust safety management system as well as ensuring compliance with safety regulatory requirements. Safety management system All levels of management and staff are committed to adopting leading practices in managing safety and risks, in line with international and national standards to achieve the highest level of safety performance.

The core functions of the ASU are to: Ensure that all safety processes within the organisation are aligned Monitor the safety performance of operational groups Manage the confidential hazard identification process Provide guidance and advice on safety management matters Changi Airport Group is committed to the establishment of a process where hazards that are likely to jeopardise safety or weaken safety defences are proactively identified and managed. Safety reporting The online hazard reporting application is a voluntary and confidential reporting system that is managed by the ASU. It provides a channel for airport users to report hazards and offer suggestions to address the hazards. No action shall be taken against any personnel who reports a safety concern unless it is due to an illegal act, gross negligence, and/or deliberate or wilful disregard of regulations or procedures. Please click here to report a hazard. In addition to the online hazard reporting channel, airport users who wish to report hazards which require immediate attention may do so at the following 24/7 hotline numbers: +65 6541 2424 (Changi Airport) +65 6481 5077 (Seletar Airport) AVIATION SECURITY Ensuring the safety and security of passengers is critical to all our airport operations.

    "content": "Future Developments Future Developments Building for the future to secure Changi Airport’s position as a leading air hub ABOUT CHANGI EAST ABOUT TERMINAL 5 MILESTONES FAQS What is changi east? Spanning a massive 1,080 hectares, the Changi East development will provide future capacity for Changi Airport. The development will serve to secure Singapore’s air hub status and ensure its continued competitiveness and relevance. As Changi Airport’s largest expansion project to date, the development includes: Changi Airport’s fifth terminal, Terminal 5 (T5) A three-runway system The construction of tunnels and other underground systems Landside and aviation support facilities The Changi East Industrial Zone Key Highlights T5 and Supporting Structure Terminal 5 is a project undertaken by Changi Airport Group, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, and the Ministry of Transport. T5 will be linked to the other terminals at Changi Airport, allowing the expanded Changi Airport to be operated as a single, integrated airport for ease of transfer between different terminals with airfield operational efficiency. New facilities, such as navigation aids, airfield lighting systems and a fire station will also be constructed. Three-Runway System The existing third runway, previously used only by the military, has been extended from 2.75km to 4km to handle larger passenger aircraft, and converted for joint military-civilian use. Under the three-runway programme, almost 40km of new taxiways will also be built to connect the runway with the rest of Changi Airport. This three-runway system is scheduled for operationalisation by the mid-2020s. Changi East Industrial Zone Expansion of Cargo Facilities Changi Airport’s cargo facilities, currently located at the Changi Airfreight Centre, will be expanded to the Changi East Industrial Zone (CEIZ) as part of the Changi East Development. The zone will be developed for airfreight, air express and Maintenance, Repair and Operations (MRO) activities. Together with the remodelled Changi Airfreight Centre, Changi’s handling capabilities will increase from 3 million tonnes per annum today, to 5.4 million tonnes per annum in its end-state, when the project is completed. A Smart Air Cargo Hub The future expanded air cargo hub will be smarter, more connected and more efficient. The use of data and technology with a focus on automation will reduce processing time, and improve productivity and cargo visibility. Strategic infrastructure planning will ensure greater operational efficiency, with dedicated lanes for autonomous guided vehicles. Direct access to freighter aircraft from cargo and express terminals will also speed up cargo flows. With environmental and workplace sustainability in mind, the new air cargo hub will feature eco-friendly handling equipment, convenient amenities and a land transport network for staff. TERMINAL 5 Terminal 5 is an integral part of the Changi East development, which will position Singapore to capture future growth opportunities in the region. Terminal 5’s roof design is an assembly of overlapping roof leaves with varying heights, creating a variety of spaces that are more human-scale. This provides a cosy feel within the mega terminal. The curved shapes of the roof allow natural light to filter through, evoking a sense of dynamism and excitement of flight. All the buildings in Terminal 5 will be connected via an automated people mover system. There will also be an extension to Terminal 2, where passengers can connect to the rest of Changi Airport. Arriving passengers can conveniently hop onto the automated people mover system which will bring them directly to the Arrival Immigration Hall. Passengers are greeted by Terminal 5's vertical gardens as they make their way to the baggage claim belt, providing them with a warm welcome to Singapore. The sculpted columns and ceilings of the underground MRT station mimic rain trees, creating a connection to nature. T5 will be a place of shared experiences where precious memories with friends and family are forged. Terminal 5 (T5) is located within the 1,080-hectare Changi East development. The terminal is designed with the flexibility to be built in two phases, in line with traffic growth. In its first phase, T5 will be able to handle about 50 million passenger movements per year and is expected to be operational around the mid-2030s. It will allow Changi Airport to significantly increase its handling capacity and strengthen its position as a premier air hub as travel demand continues to increase in the decades ahead. T5 will be linked to the existing terminals at Changi Airport, so that the airport can operate as a single integrated air hub. It will house a ground transportation centre that brings together train, bus, taxi and other transport services. T5 also offers the possibility of enhanced air and sea connectivity - for more seamless passenger travel, including convenient connections to neighbouring destinations via ferry services. Drawing on lessons learnt from the Covid-19 pandemic, T5 has also been designed with the flexibility to operate as smaller sub-terminals when needed. Specialised provisions to reduce the transmission of diseases will also be deployed in T5, including contactless systems at passenger touchpoints and enhanced ventilation systems. As a new gateway to Singapore, T5 offers new possibilities and will bring new surprises. It will reinforce Changi Airport’s status as a national icon and be a place of shared experiences across generations of Singaporeans, where precious memories are forged with friends and family. A MEGA-YET-COSY TERMINAL T5’s design concept is characterised by a unique collection of overlapping curved roofs with varying heights. The ‘roof leaves’ break the mega terminal building into smaller spaces that are more human scale. Combined with natural light and landscaping at appropriate spaces, the terminal will have a cosy yet uplifting feel. To make it easier for passengers to get around the terminal, an automated people mover (APM) system will be used to reduce walking distances. Together with travellators, walking distances in T5 will be comparable to Changi’s current terminals. The APM network will also link T5 to Terminal 2, facilitating seamless transfers to the other terminals. A TECHNOLOGICALLY-INSPIRED TERMINAL T5 will leverage technology to automate and digitalise airport operations. This will enable the airport to operate at scale in a sustainable manner, with reduced reliance on manpower. In addition to various ongoing trials to enhance airport operations via automation, video analytics, AI and robotics are also being trialled for wider implementation in T5. Aircraft 360 Video analytics and AI help monitor aircraft turnaround activities and predict potential delays in flight departures. With full visibility of the situation, ground handlers can better deploy resources to mitigate potential delays. Autonomous Vehicle Autonomous vehicles will be used to shuttle passengers and staff in the airside. They raise workforce productivity, optimise airside road traffic and potentially improve road safety. Autonomous Baggage Transfer Autonomous baggage tractors transport baggage between terminals and aircraft, improving efficiency in bad weather, and enhancing passenger service levels. They can also load and unload Unit Load Devices using bi-directional robotic arms, eliminating the need for intermediate equipment. Automated Aerobridge Docking The automated aerobridge docking system will allow remote docking of both aerobridges onto a wide-body aircraft simultaneously, improving productivity and operational efficiency. Robotic Baggage Handling Robotic baggage handlers can operate in the terminals and under rain and lightning conditions at the aircraft stands, enabling continuous operations and timely delivery of baggage for passengers. Clean Energy Apron From 2025, all new airside light vehicles, forklifts and tractors will be electric. In the coming years, the airside electric vehicle charging network will triple to 300 points. Terminal 5 will be able to support a fully electric airside fleet. A SUSTAINABLE TERMINAL T5 will be a Green Mark Platinum Super Low Energy Building, as certified by the Building and Construction Authority.",
